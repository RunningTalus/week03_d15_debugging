DEBUGGING

1) Where is it?
2) What is it?
3) How do I fix it?


TOOLS

Chrome Developer Tools Console
	LOG: Calling the log method on the console, i.e. console.log
	ALERTS: alert() good for: preventDefault()issues
	Console/Network/Preserve log
	The Debugger


TECHNIQUES

Guess and Check (Don't do it)
Analysis (also BAD)
Logarithm Method (Subdivide and Conquer)
Sandboxing (Break out code)


TIPS

Consistent reproduction
Solve the first problem first
Test your assumptions
	Is the file included?
	Is the function being executed?
Use $().length to test existence
Understand the error messages	
Check your common mistakes
Walk through algorithms with test values

PREVENTATIVE

Unit Testing
Writing Pure Functions (vs Impure functions)
